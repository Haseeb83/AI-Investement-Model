# AI-Investement-Model

I developed a comprehensive AI-powered real estate investment analysis system that evaluates the growth potential of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) across 8 U.S. states. The model combines economic indicators such as population growth, job growth, migration trends, vacancy rates, and housing supply metrics with a deep learning LSTM model to forecast future investment potential.

The system assigns dynamic scores to each MSA, visualizes trends using interactive plots, and generates actionable insights for asset classes including single-family homes, apartment complexes, and commercial warehouses. Custom visualizations (stacked bar charts, scatter plots, violin plots) and model-backed predictions enable data-driven decisions for real estate investors.

# Key features:

LSTM-based score prediction model
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook
Data from public economic & housing sources (Census, BLS, HUD)
Visual and written investment recommendations for each asset class

Clear communication of high-opportunity MSAs with future growth potential

This tool was designed for use by real estate investors and financial analysts seeking to identify and prioritize the most promising markets for capital deployment over the next 5â€“10 years.
